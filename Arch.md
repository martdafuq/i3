### Why Arch?

> Because **Arch Linux** is minimal and doesn't include bloatware GUI apps like **Gnome System Monitor**, I can get all the system information I need directly from the Terminal.

> I like the command to install packages using `pacman`.

> You can checkout [Linux](Linux.md#linux-overview).

> I prefer to use Arch with [i3](i3.md).
