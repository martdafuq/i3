#### **What is Ranger?**

**Ranger** is a lightweight, console-based file manager designed for Unix-like systems. Itâ€™s known for its minimalist and keyboard-driven interface, offering powerful navigation with a unique multi-column view that resembles the style of _Miller columns_, similar to macOS Finder.

Here are some key features:

- **VI-style key bindings**: Navigation and file management use familiar Vim shortcuts, making it fast and intuitive for Vim users.
- **Preview pane**: It shows a preview of the selected file or directory contents, which can be customized to display text, images, and even PDFs.
- **Customizable and extensible**: Configuration files allow you to personalize the layout, add scripts, and set key bindings. Users can define commands and map custom shortcuts for various tasks.
- **File operations and batch tasks**: Ranger supports copy, move, delete, and rename, as well as batch operations on multiple files at once.
- **Integration with other tools**: You can open files in external applications and integrate Ranger with tools like `ffmpeg` for media previews, `highlight` for syntax highlighting, and `ueberzug` for image previews.

>Overall, Ranger is an efficient and versatile tool for users who prefer a terminal-based file management experience and like to navigate with the keyboard.
